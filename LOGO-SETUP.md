# Refill Health Logo Setup Instructions

## To get the exact logo in your dashboard:

### Option 1: Use the Actual Logo Image (Recommended)

1. **Save the logo image** you provided as `refill-health-logo.png`
2. **Place it in the `public` folder** of your project
3. The navbar component is already configured to use: `/refill-health-logo.png`

### Option 2: Convert to SVG

If you have the original logo file, you can:

1. Export it as an SVG from your design tool
2. Replace the current SVG code in `app/components/Navbar.tsx`

### Current Setup

The navbar component is set up to use an image file:

```jsx
<img
  src="/refill-health-logo.png"
  alt="Refill Health Logo"
  className="logo-image"
  width={119}
  height={42}
/>
```

### File Location

- **Place your logo file here**: `public/refill-health-logo.png`
- **Dimensions**: 119px Ã— 42px (aspect ratio 17:6)
- **Format**: PNG or SVG (PNG recommended for complex designs)

### Steps to Add Your Logo:

1. Save the Refill Health logo image as `refill-health-logo.png`
2. Copy it to the `public` folder in your project
3. Refresh your browser - the exact logo will appear!

The logo will automatically display with the correct dimensions and styling to match your Figma design perfectly.
